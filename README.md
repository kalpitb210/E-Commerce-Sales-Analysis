Analyzing the dataset that offers valuable insights into Target's Brazilian operations, revealing details about order processing, pricing strategies, payment and shipping efficiency, customer demographics, product characteristics, and customer satisfaction. 






## Data Source
The data for this project was sourced from Kaggle, which is consist of 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018. 

It includes detailed information on order status, pricing, payment and shipping performance, customer locations, product attributes, and customer reviews. 

This comprehensive dataset is a valuable resource for understanding various business aspects and enhancing strategic decision-making.
[Target Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devarajv88/target-dataset?select=products.csv).

## Data Importation
To import the data, I used the **'mysql.connector'** library to establish a connection to SQL database.

The dataset comprises the following seven tables: 
- customers
- orders
- order_items
- sellers
- products
- geolocations
- payments
## Data Cleaning and Preparation
**Data Loading and Preparation:** 
Data was imported and converted into pandas DataFrames for further analysis.

**Handling Missing Values:** Missing values were handled by mean and mode imputation techniques.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, categorized into Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced Queries.

### Basic Queries:
- List all unique cities where customers are located.
- Count the number of orders placed in 2017.
- Find the total sales per category.
- Calculate the percentage of orders that were paid in installments.
- Count the number of customers from each state.

### Intermediate Queries:
- Calculate the number of orders per month in 2018.
- Find the average number of products per order, grouped by customer city.
- Calculate the percentage of total revenue contributed by each product category.
- Identify the correlation between product price and the number of times a product has been purchased.
- Calculate the total revenue generated by each seller, and rank them by revenue.

### Advanced Queries:
- Calculate the moving average of order values for each customer over their order history.
- Calculate the cumulative sales per month for each year.
- Calculate the year-over-year growth rate of total sales.
- Calculate the retention rate of customers, defined as the percentage of customers who make another purchase within 6 months of their first purchase.
- Identify the top 3 customers who spent the most money in each year.
## Key Findings

- **São Paulo**, **Santa Catarina**, **Alagoas**, **Paraíba**, **Pará** - These five states have the highest number of customers in Brazil.

- **Bed Table Bath**, **Health and Beauty**, **Computer Accessories**, **Furniture and Decoration**, **Watches and Presents** - These categories are the top five in terms of sales volume.

- **Padre Carvalho**, **Celso Ramos**, **Datas**, **Candido Godoi**, **Matias Olímpio** - These cities have the highest average number of orders.

- Between 2016 and 2018, the year **2018** recorded the highest sales.

- There are no customers who have made another purchase within six months of their first purchase. This indicates a potential issue with customer retention.

## Recommendations
- Develop and implement strategies to improve customer retention. Analyze customer behavior to understand reasons for low repeat purchase rates and address any barriers.

- Investigate the reason why 2018 had the highest sales and identify successful strategies or factors contributing to this peak. Use these insights to replicate successful practices and improve sales strategies for other years.

- Increase visibility and promotions for other product categories where sales are lower.

- Increase local promotions and events in geolocation areas to boost sales where they are currently low.
## Learnings

- This project has provided a valuable experience in data exportation and importation, cleaning, and analysis using SQL and Python pandas. 
- I gained a deeper understanding of SQL queries, data visualization techniques, and business analytics.
